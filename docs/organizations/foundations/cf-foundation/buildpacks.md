# Buildpacks

> Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for apps.
> Buildpacks typically examine your apps to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure the apps to communicate with bound services.
> When you push an app, Cloud Foundry automatically detects an appropriate buildpack for it.
> This buildpack is used to compile or prepare your app for launch.

## How do they work

- `bin/detect`: Can I handle this?
- `bin/supply`: If yes, provide the dependencies
- `bin/finalize`: Prepare the app for launch - runs only for the last buildpack
- `bin/release`: Build the metadata (env variables, start command, etc)
