# Rancher Desktop

> An open-source desktop application for Mac, Windows and Linux.
Rancher Desktop runs Kubernetes and container management on your desktop.
You can choose the version of Kubernetes you want to run.
You can build, push, pull, and run container images using either containerd or Moby (dockerd).
The container images you build can be run by Kubernetes immediately without the need for a registry.
