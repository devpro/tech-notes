# Edge computing with AWS

## Products

### Wavelength

> AWS Wavelength enables developers to build applications that deliver ultra-low latencies to mobile devices and end users.
> Wavelength deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of communications service providers' (CSP) 5G networks.
> You can extend a virtual private cloud (VPC) to one or more Wavelength Zones.
> You can then use AWS resources like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to run the applications that require ultra-low latency and a connection to AWS services in the Region.
