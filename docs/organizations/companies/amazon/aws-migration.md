### Application Migration Service

> AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is a highly automated lift-and-shift (rehost) solution that simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating applications to AWS.
> It allows companies to lift-and-shift a large number of physical, virtual, or cloud servers without compatibility issues, performance disruption, or long cutover windows.
> MGN replicates source servers into your AWS account.
> When you’re ready, it automatically converts and launches your servers on AWS so you can quickly benefit from the cost savings, productivity, resilience, and agility of the Cloud.
> Once your applications are running on AWS, you can leverage AWS services and capabilities to quickly and easily replatform or refactor those applications – which makes lift-and-shift a fast route to modernization.
