# Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) in AWS

## Presentation

> A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.
>
> CDNs work by establishing a point of presence (POP) or a group of CDN edge servers at multiple geographical locations.
> This geographically distributed network works on the principles of caching, dynamic acceleration, and edge logic computations.

## Products

### CloudFront

> Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users.
> CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.
> When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
