# Ansible Inventory

> Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or ‚Äúhosts‚Äù in your infrastructure at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as inventory. Once your inventory is defined, you use patterns to select the hosts or groups you want Ansible to run against.

## Inventory types

Inventory can be static or [dynamic](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html) (stored in EC2 for example).

## Inventory plugins

> Inventory plugins allow users to point at data sources to compile the inventory of hosts that Ansible uses to target tasks, either using the -i /path/to/file and/or -i 'host1, host2' command line parameters or from other configuration sources.
