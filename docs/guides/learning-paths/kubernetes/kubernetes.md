# Kubernetes

You'll find here training exercises to **learn and practice Kubernetes from Zero**.

## Requirements

### Terminal

We'll mainly execute commands from a terminal window. Make sure you chose one you are familiar with.

### kubectl

[`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) is the Kubernetes Command Line Interface tool.

It must be installed prior to any other action: [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

### (Optional) IDE

We are going to create and update YAML files. Some people may be confortable in using IDE, like Visual Studio Code, to do so.
