### Cloud Map

> AWS Cloud Map is a cloud resource discovery service. With Cloud Map, you can define custom names for your application resources, and it maintains the updated location of these dynamically changing resources.
> This increases your application availability because your web service always discovers the most up-to-date locations of its resources.
