### Microservice

> Microservices are small, modular, and independently deployable services. Docker containers (for Linux and Windows) simplify deployment and testing by bundling a service and its dependencies into a single unit, which is then run in an isolated environment.

### Feature flags

Feature flags are a great way to do continuous delivery with the latest source code and activate when needed new functionalities. But there is a cost that is described in an article from [opensource](https://opensource.com/article/18/7/does-progressive-exposure-really-come-cost).

### Communication

Two standards are recommended:

* [REST](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
* gRPC

As of 2019, REST is still more widely used but gRPC contains great improvements and will be used more and more for new microservices.

You can easily find comparison between REST and gRPC on the internet, for example [code.tutsplus.com](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/rest-vs-grpc-battle-of-the-apis--cms-30711). There is an interesting summary on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/comparison?view=aspnetcore-3.0).
