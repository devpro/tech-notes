# Configured development environment ADR - September, 2024

This study is strongly related to the subject of Cloud Development Environment (CDE).

## Context and problem statement

As a trainer, I need to provide a configured development environment to the trainees so the training sessions can be efficient.

As a manager, I want to enforce recommended code & security practices so the developer's time is optimized and the risk of losing sensitive information is minimized.

## Requirements

* Development dependencies can be configured (SDK, runtimes)
* Container can be executed with a managed lifecycle
* IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as Visual Studio Code can be used in the web or locally

## Considered options

## Decision outcome

⛵ Experimentation in progress!

* 🔴 **DevPod** doesn't work with Docker on Windows 10 + Ubuntu 20.04 (WSL)
* 🟠 **GitHub Codespaces** can quickly be expensive with a limited featureset
* 🟢 **Strong Network** works well and offers the most advanced professional features (security, user management, collaboration)
